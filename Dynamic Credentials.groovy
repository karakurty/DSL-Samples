Cloudbees Flow DSL: Use of dynamic credentials parameters

Dynamic credentials are those that are entered as parameters at runtime and only last the duration of a job or pipeline
 run. These can be used as an alternative to static credentials which are saved to a project. The ideas is that a user
 can be prompted for credentials when they are needed for the execution to pipeline tasks.
